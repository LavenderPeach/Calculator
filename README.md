# Calculator

Worked with HTML and CSS to create a sleek calculator design with customized buttons of different colors and sizes. Also added a hover feature to change the color of buttons before they are clicked.
Worked with JavaScript to allow two operands to equal any value with the utmost accuracy. Buttons can be pressed and their value is inserted into the screen. The value moves from a current screen (showing current operands) to a prior screen (showing first operand) upon the selection of an operator.
